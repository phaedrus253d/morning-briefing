Go forth and fear no darkness.
Godspeed.
The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.
Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn't matter.
Wherever there is a human being there is an opportunity for kindness.
First tell yourself what you want to be, then act your part accordingly.
I bear the wounds of all the battles I avoided. -Fernando Pessoa
When you stand before God you cannot say, "But I was told by others to do thus," or that virtue was not convenient at the time; this will not suffice.
Face the day with bravery and grace.
May your journey be touched by the light of understanding and empathy.
Peace be with you.
Live long and prosper.
No weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed, and you shall refute every tongue that rises against you in judgment.
Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
